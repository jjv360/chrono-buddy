<h3 align="center">Companion app for Full Android watches</h3>

## About

This project aims to replace the companion app provided by some manufacturers of Full Android watches. These watches do not run Android Wear OS, but instead a full Android with a watch-friendly launcher installed.

Quite often, the interfaces provided on these watches is not very good. This app aims to replace those companion apps.

This app also uses peer-to-peer networking to synchronise data between the watch and the phone, with no central authority.
